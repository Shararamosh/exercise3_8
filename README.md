# Review Form Project

This project consists of a simple HTML form where users can submit reviews, including their name, rating, and a comment. The form sends the data to a PHP script for processing.

## Files in this project:

1. **Index.html** - The main HTML file with a form for users to input their reviews.
2. **save_review.php** - A PHP script that processes the form data and outputs the submitted information.
3. **README.md** - This file, explaining how the project works.

## How it works:
- The form in `Index.html` allows the user to enter their name, rating (1 to 5), and a comment.
- After submitting, the data is sent to `save_review.php`, where it is displayed.

## Setup:
1. Place all files on a web server with PHP support.
2. Open the `Index.html` file in your browser and fill out the form.
3. Upon submission, the review data will be processed and displayed by the `save_review.php` script.

Enjoy using the review form!
